    """
    The explanations below will mention a queue as if it was a variable. In fact, it is! The variable 'to_infect'
    represents a queue of all the node that we will infect. Let's dive into the mechanism.

    Executes a step of a breadth first search in the graph 'g' starting at 'root' with know states.
    The idea is the following:
        1) at start, no infected. Just the root in queue.
        2) each call of this function represents a step in the search (the spread).
            2) A) We unqueue a vertice
            2) B) Then we infect some of its neighbors
                Because scientifically, the r0 is an average, in this project we first define it, then we define
                its variation: the r0_delta.
                Doing so, each vertice can infect a random number of vertices between: r0 - r0_delta and r0 + r0_delta.
                Thus, during the spread of the disease, if we calculate the r0 manually (average of the number of
                infected by vertice) we will find the r0 we defined earlier.
            2) C) And we add them to the queue, to check later their own neighbors
        3) At the end of the step, we return all information needed to call the function later at the same step.

    WARNING: A vertice can be queued and infected.
    Indeed, being queued means that at the next step we will be infected.
    So, during the next step we are infected. But during this step (where we are infected) the algorithm also selects
    our neighbors to infect during the next step.
    However, not all of our neighbors are necessarily infected! As mentioned we select randomly the neighbors to infect.
    Thus, we can be queued (again), because we are still infected and not all of our neighbors are infected !

    Parameters
    ----------
    g: type Graph_dict: The graph in which we search.
    locked: type list: Vertices under lockdown -> they can not infect other vertices.
    immune: type list: Vertices immuned -> they can not infect other vertices.
    step_id: type int: The nÂ° of the current step. Used to identify the first call.
    root: Name of the first infected vertice.
    r0: type int: The r0 of the spread.
    r0_delta: type int: The delta/variation of the r0
    to_infect: type list: A list of all the neighbors that has been selected to be infected later on.
    infected: type list: A list of all the infected nodes.

    Returns
    -------
    type dict: a dictionnary with all the values that need to be sent to call the function later.
